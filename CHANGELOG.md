# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is inspired by Keep a Changelog, and this project adheres to semantic versioning for the Python package. The native SDK binaries are versioned independently.

## 1.0.0 â€“ 2025-08-21

- Integrates aic-sdk `v0.6.2`.
- Removed initialize(); all initialization now happens in `Model.__init__`.
- New constructor API:
  - `sample_rate` is required
  - `channels` defaults to 1
  - `frames` defaults to None and uses `optimal_num_frames()`
- Auto-selection of concrete model is performed only for `QUAIL_L` or `QUAIL_S` families; explicit types (e.g., `QUAIL_L48`, `QUAIL_S16`, `QUAIL_XS`) are honored as-is.
- Enabled noise gate by default (`AICParameter.NOISE_GATE_ENABLE = 1.0`).
- Updated docs and examples to constructor-only API.
- Added integration test to validate `optimal_sample_rate()` behavior for `QUAIL_L` at 8 kHz.
- CI: Workflow now downloads native SDK assets using `[tool.aic-sdk].sdk-version` from `pyproject.toml`, while Python package version comes from the tag.
