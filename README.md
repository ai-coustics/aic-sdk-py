# ai-coustics SDK for Python (`aicoustics`)

This repository provides prebuilt Python wheels for the ai|coustics real-time audio enhancement SDK, compatible with a variety of platforms and Python versions.

## ðŸ“¦ Available Wheels

All wheels are for version `0.5.0a1`:

- **Linux (x86_64)**
  - cp39
  - cp310
  - cp311

- **macOS (arm64)**
  - cp39
  - cp310
  - cp311

- **Windows**
  - cp39 (win32, amd64)
  - cp310 (win32, amd64)
  - cp311 (win32, amd64)

## ðŸ“¥ Install on MacOS
Using `uv`:
```
 uv venv --python 3.10
 uv pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## ðŸ”‘ License Key

The ai|coustics SDK requires a valid license key to function. You'll need to obtain a license key from ai|coustics and set it up in your application before using the SDK.

Contact ai|coustics to obtain your license key for accessing the real-time audio enhancement features.

## ðŸŽ§ Optimal Configuration & Latency

The library supports **arbitrary sample rates and input buffer sizes**, but to achieve **lowest algorithmic latency**, it is strongly recommended to use:

- **Sample Rate:** `48 kHz`
- **Buffer Size:** `512 samples`

These settings ensure real-time responsiveness and optimal model performance across all platforms.

## ðŸš€ Example: Enhance WAV File

This repository includes a script to process WAV files using the SDK.

### Usage

```bash
python enhance.py input.wav output.wav --strength 80

```
